    <h2>Must Knows About Web3.0</h2>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Web3, also known as the "decentralized web," refers to the next generation of the internet that is being built on top of blockchain technology. It aims to create a more transparent, secure, and decentralized internet by enabling peer-to-peer interactions without the need for intermediaries like centralized servers or platforms.</p>
            <p>In other words, web3 aims to empower users with greater control over their data, privacy, and online identity, while also enabling new types of applications and business models that were previously impossible on the traditional web.</p>

            <h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Web3.0 is seen as a way to address some of the fundamental issues with the traditional web, such as censorship, data breaches, and the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few large corporations. By enabling a more decentralized and democratic internet, web3 has the potential to create a more open, inclusive, and equitable society.</p>

            <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Blockchain is a technology that allows for secure and transparent record-keeping of transactions and data in a decentralized network. Think of it as a digital ledger or notebook that is distributed across a network of computers.</p>

            <p>The information recorded in the blockchain is stored in blocks that are linked together, forming a chain. Each block contains a unique digital fingerprint of the previous block, which ensures that the information in the blockchain is secure and cannot be tampered with.</p>
            
            <p>Because the blockchain is decentralized, there is no need for a central authority or intermediary to oversee and verify transactions, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management and more.</p>
            
            <p>To achieve this, blockchain uses advanced cryptography, which is a way of making data unreadable and secure. This helps protect the data from being tampered with or stolen. The unique digital fingerprint of each block is called a hash, and it helps ensure that the blockchain is secure and tamper-proof.</p>

            <h3>What is Decentralization?</h3>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Decentralization means distributing control and decision-making across a network rather than having a single authority in charge. In web3, there is no central authority or intermediary, and the network is made up of many individual nodes working together. It also empowers individual users with greater control over their data and online interactions. Overall, decentralization is a key principle of web3, enabling a more democratic, open, and equitable internet.</p>

            <h3>What are Smart Contracts?</h3>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Smart contracts are like digital agreements that can be programmed to execute certain actions when specific conditions are met. They are stored on a blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent. This means that once a smart contract is executed, it cannot be changed or deleted.</p>

            <p>For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically transfer ownership of a digital asset from one person to another once payment has been received. This eliminates the need for a middleman, such as a bank, to facilitate the transaction.</p>
            
            <p>Smart contracts enable faster, more secure, and efficient transactions, as they are self-executing and do not require intermediaries. They are a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management and more.</p>
